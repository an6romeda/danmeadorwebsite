# danmeador.work

Personal site. Privacy lawyer. This is not a resume.

## What's here

A single-page site with four sections:

- **About** — The short version of a longer story
- **Side quests** — Things I'm building (Mnemosyne, Falconwatch)
- **Library** — Books, podcasts, articles shaping my thinking
- **Contact** — Where to find me

## Built with

HTML, CSS, JavaScript. No frameworks, no build step. Just files.

```
index.html    # Everything
style.css     # Dark theme, amber/blue accents
script.js     # Typewriter, modals, scroll behavior
images/       # Headshot, article thumbnails
```

## Run locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve
```

## Details that matter

- Typewriter effect sets the tone
- Project cards open modals with live site previews
- Library toggles between current and past influences
- Navigation highlights based on scroll position
- Responsive down to mobile

## The aesthetic

Near-black backgrounds. Amber and blue gradient accents. Dot grid pattern. Subtle glow on interaction. Clean, dark, intentional.
